\section{Introduction}

This is our language specification for the MAlice programming language, which encapsulates our understanding and interpretation of the syntax and semantics of the language. This syntax and these semantics will form the basis for our compiler for MAlice programs.

Our definitions of syntax are provided in a semi-formal way: we are using a combination of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) and Augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF). We are using the repetition syntax from EBNF, such as expressions surrounded by left and right braces (`{' and `}') which denotes zero or more occurrences of the expression, and left and right square brackets (`[' and `]') which denote optional expressions.

We are also using \texttt{ALPHA} and \texttt{DIGIT} from ABNF. \texttt{ALPHA} represents the letters A--Z and a--z and \texttt{DIGIT} represents the digits 0--9. This allows our specification to be more succinct and easier to read.

% This is an \emph{introductory comment}.
% \LaTeX\ can typeset some very complex documents, but it is also
% \textbf{quite easy to get started}.
% Try playing around with this file and see. 
% Don't worry that this page looks very spaced out,
% \LaTeX\ arranges the page for you (much less work to do than in Word!)
% so if there was more content it would close up the gaps.

% To start a new paragraph just leave a blank line.
% If you do not like numbered sections, use the \texttt{section*\{...\}}
% environment instead.


% To include maths formulas in text put them between \$ symbols like this
% $f(x) = x \times 5$.
% Or to display a formula on a line on its own you do this:
% \[
%     g(y) = y^2
% \]
\section{Types}

MAlice is a strongly typed language and supports the primitive types \texttt{number} and \texttt{letter}. The special \texttt{looking-glass} type is analagous to a \texttt{void} type as in C-style languages, and is used to denote that a function does not return a value.

We define \texttt{type} in BNF as:
\begin{verbatim}
  Type -> "number" | "letter"
\end{verbatim}

\section{Functions and Programs}

Our MAlice dialect supports function declarations. Functions begin with `The' followed by an optional return type, a name and a list of 0 or more parameters. The special \texttt{looking-glass} type is analagous to a void return type. Functions are declared in the global scope and cannot be nested.

The special function \texttt{hatta} is the entry point for MAlice programs and it is an error to have this function declaration omitted.

A MAlice program is comprised of 1 or more function declarations.

We define several BNF productions for function syntax:
\begin{verbatim}
  Function -> "The" FunctionType Identifier ArgumentList BlockUnit

  FunctionType -> Type | "looking-glass"
  ArgumentList -> "(" [DeclarationList] ")"
  BlockUnit -> "opened" StatementList "closed"}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Statements}

Each function in MAlice is comprised 0 or more statements. Statements are separated by either a full-stop, comma or the \texttt{then} token. However, the last statement in the list must be followed by a full stop.
  
\section{Expressions}

Expressions are defined recursively, and are only well-defined over numerical values.

\section{Variable Assignment}

Variable Assignment is of the form:

/begin {verbatim}
Assignment      -> Identifier "became" Expression
/end {verbatim}

\section{Declarations}

Variable declarations follow the form:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{identifier} \texttt{was a} \textbf{type}
\end{quote}

Lists of variable declarations consist of single variable declarations separated by a comma. The only exception to this is the last variable declaration, which is preceded by an `and' and no comma. For example, this is a valid variable declaration list:

\begin{verbatim}
x was a number, y was a letter and z was a number
\end{verbatim}

whilst this:

\begin{verbatim}
x was a number, y was a letter, z was a number
\end{verbatim}

is not. Where there are one or more consecutive declarations of variables which share the same type, the second and later declarations can be optionally postfixed with `too', as in:

\begin{verbatim}
p was a letter, q was a number and r was a number too
\end{verbatim}

It is an error to append `too' to a declaration for a variable whose type is different to that of the previous variable declaration's type, as in:

\begin{verbatim}
p was a letter, q was a number too and r was a number
\end{verbatim}

The formal definitions for variable declaration syntax:

\begin{verbatim}
  Declaration -> Identifier "was a" Type
  DeclarationList -> Declaration [{"," Declaration ["too"]} "and" Declaration ["too"]]
\end{verbatim}

\section{Assignment}

Variable assignment is also designed to closely mirror the grammatical structure of the English language.

\section{BNF Grammar} 

Beginning here, we look at the formalised BNF Grammar. This utilises Extended BNF and the constructs defined above.

\begin{verbatim}

Declaration     -> Identifier "was a" Type
DeclarationList -> Declaration [{"," Declaration ["too"]} "and" Declaration ["too"]]

Assignment      -> Identifier "became" Expression
AssignmentList  -> Assignment [{"and" Assignment} "but" Assignment]

BlockUnit       -> "opened" StatementList "closed"

StatementList   -> ""
                 | Statement "."
                 | Statement Split StatementList
               
Statement       -> DeclarationList
                 | AssignmentList
                 | Expression "said Alice"
                 | Identifier "ate"
                 | Identifier "drank"

Split           -> "."
                 | ","
                 | "then"

Term            -> Identifier
                 | Number
                 | UnaryOperator (Term | Expression)
Expression      -> Expression BinaryOperator Term

Program         -> Function+
Function        -> "The" FunctionType Identifier ArgumentList BlockUnit

FunctionType    -> Type
                 | "looking-glass"
ArgumentList    -> "(" [DeclarationList] ")"

BinaryOperator  -> "+"
                 | "-"
                 | "*"
                 | "/" 
                 | "%"

UnaryOperator   -> "~" 

Value           -> Number | Letter

Letter          -> ALPHA

Number          -> ["-"] DIGIT+

Type            -> "number"
                 | "letter"

\end{verbatim}


% \section{Semantics}

% Here is a numbered list.

% \begin{enumerate}

%     \item
%     This is item 1.
    
%     \item
%     And this is item 2.
    
% \end{enumerate}

% And here is a bulleted list.

% \begin{itemize}

%     \item
%     The parts of the list are called items here too.
    
% \end{itemize}

% Finally for this document, if you want to include a reference
% then you put it into a \texttt{thebibliography\{...\}}
% environment (see below in source file) and then 
% cite it like this \cite{lamport94}
% (you will need to run \texttt{latex} twice to get it to process the citation),
% or you can use BibTex but that is probably overkill for now.

% \begin{thebibliography}{9}

% \bibitem{lamport94}
%   Leslie Lamport,
%   \emph{\LaTeX: A Document Preparation System}.
%   Addison Wesley, Massachusetts,
%   2nd Edition,
%   1994.
