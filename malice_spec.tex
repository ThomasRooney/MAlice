\section{Introduction}

This is the initial language specification for the Malice language defined by the Imperial Departmnet of Computing. 

We are using a combination of Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), which extends BNF by adding constructs such as repetition rules ({ and } for 0 or more occurrences and + for 1 or more occurrences.)

We are also using `ALPHA` and `DIGIT` from Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) which represent the digits 0-9 and letters A-Za-z respectively. This allows our specification to be more succinct and easier to read.

% This is an \emph{introductory comment}.
% \LaTeX\ can typeset some very complex documents, but it is also
% \textbf{quite easy to get started}.
% Try playing around with this file and see. 
% Don't worry that this page looks very spaced out,
% \LaTeX\ arranges the page for you (much less work to do than in Word!)
% so if there was more content it would close up the gaps.

% To start a new paragraph just leave a blank line.
% If you do not like numbered sections, use the \texttt{section*\{...\}}
% environment instead.

To include maths formulas in text put them between \$ symbols like this
$f(x) = x \times 5$.
Or to display a formula on a line on its own you do this:
\[
    g(y) = y^2
\]

\section{Semantics}

Here is a numbered list.

\begin{enumerate}

    \item
    This is item 1.
    
    \item
    And this is item 2.
    
\end{enumerate}

And here is a bulleted list.

\begin{itemize}

    \item
    The parts of the list are called items here too.
    
\end{itemize}

Finally for this document, if you want to include a reference
then you put it into a \texttt{thebibliography\{...\}}
environment (see below in source file) and then 
cite it like this \cite{lamport94}
(you will need to run \texttt{latex} twice to get it to process the citation),
or you can use BibTex but that is probably overkill for now.
